Conquest Chess is a multiplayer chess matchmaking application with added leader-board tracking. This app allows you to queue individual rooms to play others or join game rooms as an opponent or a viewer. Wins, losses and draws are automatically calculated at the end of each match (or at the time of surrender/abrupt disconnection) and career stats can be viewed in their appropriate page. At the time of writing this readme, true leader-board implementation is not available but is planned to be added in the future.
